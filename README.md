# LINKIT (formerly Chainlink Job Spec Viz)

1) <b>Drag and connect tasks to visually program your Chainlink job spec.</b>
1) <b>Test and debug the job spec by simulating execution using much of the same code as a real Chainlink node.</b>
1) <b>The generated TOML can be copied to your Chainlink node and you're good to go!</b>

<b>Disclaimer: This app is in early development and some features are yet to be implemented. Expect bugs!</b>

Select and configure your job type.

Drag from the task handles to add new tasks to your pipeline.

As you enter configuration details the 'Codegen' panel will change in realtime.

Open the 'Test' panel and enable test mode to parse your job spec and enable you to simulate execution of the pipeline.

<i>Most tasks are executed exactly as they would be on a real Chainlink node but tasks which normally produce side-effects are simulated. For example, the EthTx task will not submit a transaction to the blockchain.</i>

Once you're happy with your job spec, copy the generated TOML to your clipboard â€” ready to paste into your Chainlink node's job spec config panel!
