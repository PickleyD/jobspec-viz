# LINKIT - Chainlink Job Spec Editor

1) <b>Drag and connect tasks to visually program your Chainlink job spec.</b>
2) <b>Use AI to generate parts of your pipeline using natural language.</b>
3) <b>Test and debug the job spec by simulating execution using much of the same code as a real Chainlink node.</b>
4) <b>The generated TOML can be copied to your Chainlink node and you're good to go!</b>

Live demo: https://jobspec-viz.vercel.app/

Drag from the task handles to add new tasks to your pipeline.

or pick from a pre-configured template

or import an existing job spec

Use natural language to let AI generate portions of your pipeline for you!

Open the 'Test' panel and enable test mode to parse your job spec and enable you to simulate execution of the pipeline.

<i>Most tasks are executed exactly as they would be on a real Chainlink node but tasks which normally produce side-effects are simulated. For example, the EthTx task will not submit a transaction to the blockchain.</i>

Once you're happy with your job spec, copy the generated TOML to your clipboard â€” ready to paste into your Chainlink node's job spec config panel!
